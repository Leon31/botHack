## Facebook CodeWorks Hackathon

This is a chatbot for Facebook messenger created in two days which aims to help people learning to code.

The bot is deployed on Heroku (https://yuranotbot-hackathon.herokuapp.com/webhook - the only HTML served is the privacy policy available under https://yuranotbot-hackathon.herokuapp.com///https://yuranotbot-hackathon.herokuapp.com/privacy_policy.html).

We used a sample project from Facebook showcasing the Messenger Platform as a starting point.

You will be able to reach our bot via Facebook Messenger, it's called ***Yuranotbot*** and accepts the following commands:
 - help
 - train
 - test
 - gif
 - exit
